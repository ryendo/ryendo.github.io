My name is Ryoki Endo (遠藤 凌輝), and I am currently a doctoral student at the Graduate School of Science and Technology, Niigata University, Japan. I also hold the position of a Research Fellow (DC1) at the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

My research interests lie in the field of mathematical sciences, specifically focusing on Laplacian eigenvalues, verified computation, and shape optimization problems.
